As part of a Research of the Institute for Sustainable Transportation and Logistics at University of Buffalo, the University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez Campus got a Subaward for developing a Mobile Data Collection and Sharing for Vehicle Accidents (http://www.buffalo.edu/transinfo/Research/MobileAccidentDataCollection.html). This is going to be my Master's Project.
